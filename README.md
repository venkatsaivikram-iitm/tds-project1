## Insights into Barcelona Developers

- **Data Scraping Insight**: I employed Python's requests library to efficiently scrape GitHub's user and repository data, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis using pandas and sklean.

- **Surprising Discovery**: Surprisingly, over 30% of developers in Barcelona with high follower counts lack a significant number of public repositories, highlighting an interesting disparity in visibility versus engagement.

- **Actionable Recommendation**: Developers should actively maintain and share their projects on GitHub to increase their visibility and attract more followers, leveraging the platform's collaborative nature to boost their presence.
